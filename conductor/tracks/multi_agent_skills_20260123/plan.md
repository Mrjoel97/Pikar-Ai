## Phase 1: Analysis & Planning [checkpoint: complete]
- [x] Analyze existing workflows
- [x] Analyze database schema
- [x] Analyze DynamicWorkflowGenerator
- [x] Create implementation plan document

---

## Phase 2: Skills Installation & Integration [checkpoint: complete]
- [x] Install 37 external skills via npx (57 planned, 37 available from repos)
- [x] Create external_skills.py with skill definitions (37 skills with knowledge content)
- [x] Map skills to agents (agent_ids) - all mapped by domain expertise
- [x] Integrate with library.py (import added, total 61 skills)

---

## Phase 3: Core Systems [checkpoint: complete]
- [x] Create database tables (custom_skills, user_workflows, user_executive_agents) - with indexes & RLS
- [x] Implement custom_skills_service.py - CRUD, user_id scoping, registry integration
- [x] Implement skill_creator.py - validation, templates, knowledge generation, suggestions
- [x] Enhance DynamicWorkflowGenerator - user workflow storage, pattern matching, automatic reuse
- [x] Implement user_agent_factory.py - personalized agents, business context, caching

## Phase 4: New Pipelines [checkpoint: complete]
- [x] Create financial.py workflow (6 pipelines: FinancialModel, Budget, Revenue, CostOptimization, InvestorReadiness, CashFlow)
- [x] Create LandingPageCreationPipeline (added to marketing.py with research + design stages)
- [x] Create FormCreationPipeline (added to marketing.py with LoopAgent for CRO)
- [x] Register new pipelines in registry (8 new pipelines registered)

---

## Phase 5: Loop Agent Refactoring [checkpoint: complete]
- [x] Convert content pipelines to LoopAgent (NewsletterPipeline, BlogContentPipeline, BrandVoicePipeline)
- [x] Convert compliance/HR pipelines (PerformanceReviewPipeline - ComplianceAuditPipeline already LoopAgent)
- [x] Test converted pipelines (syntax verified, max_iterations configured)

---

## Phase 6: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for skill creator
- [ ] Unit tests for user workflow storage
- [ ] Integration tests for onboarding
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing
