# Implementation Plan: ADK Compliance Remediation

This plan addresses the gaps identified in the ADK standards compliance review.

## Phase 1: Native Multi-Agent Hierarchy [COMPLETE] [e73bc8b]

- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification (Protocol in workflow.md)
- [x] **Task: Integrate Specialized Agents as sub_agents**
    - [x] Add `sub_agents=SPECIALIZED_AGENTS` to Executive Agent definition
    - [x] Remove custom delegation logging (ADK handles delegation natively)
    - [x] Update tests to verify sub_agents hierarchy

## Phase 2: Tool Signature Compliance [COMPLETE] [70e5ae8]

- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification (Protocol in workflow.md)
- [x] **Task: Fix Tool Signatures per ADK Standards**
    - [x] Remove default values from tool parameters
    - [x] Add `ToolContext` parameter where needed
    - [x] Update tool docstrings to meet ADK requirements
    - [x] Update tests for new tool signatures

## Phase 3: Production App Configuration [COMPLETE] [288c94e]

- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification (Protocol in workflow.md)
- [x] **Task: Add Production App Features**
    - [x] Add `ContextCacheConfig` for cost/latency optimization
    - [x] Add `EventsCompactionConfig` for conversation history management
    - [x] Add `ResumabilityConfig` for workflow recovery (optional)

## Phase 4: Workflow Agents Implementation (PRD-Based) [COMPLETE]

**Scope:** 53 workflows + DynamicWorkflowGenerator (see [workflow_catalog.md](workflow_catalog.md))

> **Architecture Decision:** Workflows contain ONLY specialized agents. Executive Agent handles final synthesis externally per Agent-Eco-System.md.
